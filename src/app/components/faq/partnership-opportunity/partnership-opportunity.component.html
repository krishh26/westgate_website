                                    Yes, Indian IT firms can choose from various working models such as subcontracting
                                    only, hybrid, on-site, and resource sharing, based on their preferences and project
                                    requirements.

                            <div class="text-theme"> 3. What is the difference between the subcontracting-only model and

                                <p>
                                    The subcontracting-only model involves Indian IT firms subcontracting projects to
                                    their own team in India, while the hybrid model combines subcontracting and direct
                                    involvement based on project needs.

                                <p>
                                    In the on-site model, Indian IT firms are directly involved in on-site project
                                    management and execution, providing hands-on support and expertise.
                                </p>

                                    The resource-sharing model enables Indian IT firms to generate recurring income by
                                    sharing expert resources with UK Suppliers for specific projects.
